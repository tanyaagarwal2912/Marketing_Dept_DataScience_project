A Data-Driven Case Study

Marketing plays a pivotal role in the growth and sustainability of any business. Understanding customers and tailoring campaigns to their needs is a key strategy for success. In this comprehensive case study, we unveil the journey of a data-driven project where insights derived from thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced modeling techniques steer a targeted ad marketing campaign for a prominent bank in the heart of New York City.

The Challenge: Dividing Customers into Distinctive Groups
Our client, a leading bank, tasked us with a mission: to optimize their marketing strategy by categorizing customers into at least three distinctive groups. Armed with extensive customer data from the past six months, the bank's marketing team sought to launch a targeted ad campaign tailored to specific customer needs.

The Data Science Approach: Unleashing the Power of Models
Data Preprocessing and EDA: Laying the Foundation
Before diving into modeling, we meticulously performed data preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uncovered valuable insights into customer behaviors, setting the stage for a robust modeling strategy.

K-Means Clustering: Unveiling Similarity in Diversity
We employed KMeans clustering, a powerful technique that groups similar data points based on their feature representations. By assuming that data points within a cluster are more similar to each other, KMeans helped us identify distinctive customer segments.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Uncovering the Essence of Variance
PCA, a linear dimensionality reduction technique, played a crucial role in capturing the maximum variance in the data using orthogonal components. The resulting principal components provided deeper insights into the underlying structure of customer behavior.

Autoencoders: Redefining Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Learning
Autoencoders, the unsung heroes of dimensionality reduction, were harnessed to encode the input data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving essential features. This step empowered the model to uncover intricate patterns and representations within the customer dataset.

The Results: Empowering Targeted Marketing Strategies
By synergizing K-Means, PCA, and Autoencoders, we successfully divided the bank's customers into distinctive groups, each with its unique characteristics. This data-driven segmentation, coupled with insights from data preprocessing and EDA, laid the foundation for a highly targeted ad marketing campaign.
